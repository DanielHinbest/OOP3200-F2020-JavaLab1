# OOP3200-F2020-JavaLab1
This lab was a collaboration between Daniel Hinbest and Ryan Clayson in Object-Oriented Programming II (OOP 3200) at Durham College. The purpose of the lab was to serve as an introduction to Java. The concept was to create a Java console application that allows the user to create three bowlers and store the scores, and the averages of all the bowlers.
